The complete steps are as follows

1. Unpack the ColPack sources

tar -xzf ColPack-$VERSION.tar.gz

or use your favourite extraction utility under windows.

2. In Visual Studio open the solution file

adolc.sln

select the solution 'adolc' in the Solution Explorer, from the toolbar select
the build configuration sparse and from Build menu select Build Solution 
(shortcut key F7).

This will build ColPack and link it with the sparse version of adolc.dll
