ADOL-C offers a unit-testing capability developed using the Boost.Test library.
There are more than 400 tests to verify the basic functionality of ADOL-C, including both traceless and trace-based adouble variants.

The minimum required version of BOOST library is 1.59.0. Any older version will cause compile-time errors. 
The BOOST library has to be compiled --with-test module, such that the library file boost_unit_test_framework is available.

Instructions for compiling the test suite with cmake:

1) Create the 'build' directory inside the boost-test directory (it is ignored by git).

2) In 'boost-test/build' type: 'ccmake ../' or 'cmake-gui ../'

3) Cmake will search for the system installed version of BOOST. If the minimum required version is not satisfied, please enter the path where an appropriate BOOST version is installed in '3RDPARTY_BOOST_DIR'.

4) ADOL-C has to be compiled with the same version of BOOST defined in 3). When using a different BOOST version than the one provided by the operating system, ADOL-C can be configured with --with-boost flag before compiling the ADOL-C sources.

5) In cmake, specify ADOLC_BASE directory where ADOL-C is installed.

Run the executable boost-test-adolc.
