CONTENTS OF THE DIRECTORY

  ipopt  -->  example code for the coupling of ADOL-C and Ipopt

              directories:

	      LuksanVlcek1              
	      MittelmannDistCntrlNeumA 

	              both examples from Ipopt/Ipopt/examples/ScalableProblems 

	              The directories contain examples for the coupling of Ipopt 
                      and ADOL-C. The user just has to adapted the evaluation
      	              of the target function and the constraints everything else
                      is done automatically.


	      LuksanVlcek1_sparse              
	      MittelmannDistCntrlNeumA_sparse

                      same examples as above but with automatic exploitation
                      of sparsity, hence the installation of the ColPack 
                      package is required.

	      The makefiles from the specific Ipopt installation should be used
	      and extended according to the Makefile examples contained in the
              directories.
