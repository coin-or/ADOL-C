CONTENTS OF THE DIRECTORY

  ipopt  -->  example code for the coupling of ADOL-C and Ipopt

              directories:

	      LuksanVlcek1              
	      MittelmannDistCntrlNeumA 

	      both examples from Ipopt/Ipopt/examples/ScalableProblems 

	      the directories contain examples for the coupling of Ipopt 
              and ADOL-C. The user just has to adapted the evaluation
      	      of the target function and the constraints everything else
              is done automatically.

	      The makefiles from the specific Ipopt installation should be used
	      and extended according to the Makefile examples contained in the
              directories.

	      Examples that also exploit the sparsity will be provided soon
