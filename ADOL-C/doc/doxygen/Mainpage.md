# ADOL-C: A Package for the Automatic Differentiation of Algorithms Written in C/C++

## Scope of the library

ADOL-C is a library for automatic differentiation written in C++
featuring e.g.

- traceless-forward mode
- tape-based mode
- sparse Jacobians and sparse Hessians
- external differentiated functions
- optimal checkpointing
- adapted differentiation of fixed point iterations
- parallel differentiation of OpenMP-parallel loops
- Lie derivatives of scalar, vector and covector fields


## Documentation


### Class documentation

The library contains a class documentation generated by using [doxygen].
In order to generate it, it is required that the `doxygen` program
is available and found by CMake. After the project was configured using
CMake and if doxygen was found, the documentation can
be build by calling
```shell
make doxygen
```
from within the build directory. The entry page of the documentation is located
in `ADOL-C/doc/doxygen/html/index.html` within the build directory.
For an overview of the contained features and submodules
you can e.g. refer to the [Topics](topics.html) section of the doxygen documentation.
